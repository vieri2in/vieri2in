I'm a Computer Science junior student at Colorado State University who just graduated from an IOS Bootcamp by Kodeco. My interest switched to Mobile and IOS development after I encountered Swift programming language in March 2023. From then on, I decided to fling myself into the IOS world. 

### Why I choose here

I am amazed by the changes computing can bring to the world and have kept a learning heart since my first programming course at college. Before learning Computer Science, I was a licensed architect in my native county who did not enjoy designing because I was not art-minded. I prefer to identify myself as an engineer. Fortunately, I found where my passion and talent lie after I learned Java in college. That explains why I not only did well on campus but also spent lots of time on self-learning.

Mobile development, in my eyes, is a good conbination of user experience and logical programming. It resembles my previous job of architeactural desgining, which is also the conbination of user experience, art, and tech.
