I'm Bin Li, a Computer Science senior student at Colorado State University as well as a graduate from a IOS Bootcamp by Kodeco. I am interested in cloud, full stack, distributed system, or DevOps. 

### Why I am here :interrobang:

I am amazed by the changes computing can bring to the world and have kept a learning heart since my first programming course at college. Before learning Computer Science, I was a licensed architect in my native county who did not🤕🧟‍♂️ enjoy designing much because I was not art-minded🎨🎵. Rather, `I prefer to identify myself as an engineer`👨‍🔧🦾🦿. Fortunately, I eventually found where my passion💥 and talent🧙 lie as I learned Java in college. That explains why I not only did well on campus but also spent lots of time on self-learning platforms such as YouTube, Udemy, and Kodeco.

### My skills :muscle:
- Git, GitLab, cmake, bash scripting, Linux commands 
- avaScript (advanced), NodeJS, Express, Angular, ReactJS, Redux 
- Python (beginner-level), Java (intermediate-level), C++ (intermediate-level)  
- AWS, Firebase, Docker 
- JUnit, React testing library
- UDP, TCP, HTTP and Socket programming using Socket.IO 

### What I'm currently learning 📚

- Java, Python spriting, AWS
