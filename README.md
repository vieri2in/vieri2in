I'm Bin Li, a Computer Science junior student at Colorado State University who just graduated from an IOS Bootcamp by Kodeco. My interest switched to Mobile and IOS development after I encountered Swift programming language in March 2023. From then on, I decided to fling myself into the IOS world. 

### Why I am here

I am amazed by the changes computing can bring to the world and have kept a learning heart since my first programming course at college. Before learning Computer Science, I was a licensed architect in my native county who did not enjoy designing because I was not art-minded. Rather, I prefer to identify myself as an engineer. Fortunately, I found where my passion and talent lie as I learned Java in college. That explains why I not only did well on campus but also spent lots of time on self-learning platforms such as YouTube, Udemy, and Kodeco.

Mobile development, in my eyes, is a good combination of user experience and logical programming. It resembles my previous job of architectural designing, which is also a combination of user experience, art, and tech. Luckily, this time I can do this job mainly as an engineer, not a designer.
